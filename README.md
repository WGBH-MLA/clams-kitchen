# CLAMS Kitchen
Python scripts for running CLAMS apps and using the output


## Installation

Just clone the repository, which creates a directory called `kitchen`.

Change to that directory and do a `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## Usage

The main script is `run_batch.py`.  Run `python run_batch.py -h` for help.

You will need a configuration file, which is a JSON file.  Several are included in the `example_config` directory
