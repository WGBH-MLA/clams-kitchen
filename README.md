# CLAMS Kitchen
Python scripts for running CLAMS apps and using the output

## Overview

The `run_job.py` script runs CLAMS applications against a batch of assets by looping through the items in the batch, taking several steps with each one.  For each item, the script performs the following steps:
  - checking for media files and downloading missing ones from Sony Ci
  - creating a "blank" MMIF file for the asset
  - running a CLAMS app to create data-laden MMIF
  - performing post-processing on the data-laden MMIF to create useful output
  - cleaning up (removing) downloaded media


## Installation

Clone the repository.  Change to the repository directory and do a `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## Usage

The main script is `run_job.py`.  Run `python run_job.py -h` for help.

You will need a configuration file, which is a JSON file.  See the `CONFIGURATION.md` file for details.  Several example files are included in the `sample_config` directory.


## Media 

Media files should be placed in a directory specified in the configuration.

If media files are to be downloaded from Sony Ci, then there must be a file in `./secrets/ci.yml` with the following keys:
  - `cred_string`
  - `client_id`
  - `client_secret`
  - `workspace_id`


## Current limitations

The configuration files support running multiple CLAMS apps on a single item, but this is not yet implemented.  It would require adding another inner loop (which would be fairly straightforward).

This script works with CLAMS apps running in CLI mode or as web services.  However, support for web services is more difficult and may be dropped.  One problem with using apps running as web services is that if the app fails, the script does not currently have a way to restart the web service.  Also, complex parameters, like the 'map' parameter of SWT does not work for web-service mode.
